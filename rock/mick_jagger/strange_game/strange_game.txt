Surrounded by losers
Misfits and boozers
Hanging by your fingernails
You made one mistake
You got burned at the stake
You're finished, you're foolish, you failed

There's always a hope
On this slippery slope
Somewhere a ghost of a chance
To get back in that game
And burn off your shame
And dance with the big boys again

It's a strange, strange game
Strange, strange game
Such a shame, shame, shame
Yes a strange game

You got to carry the blame
In this strange game
You're out on a limb
And you're trying to get in
It's a strange game

You piled up the corpses
Exhausted your sources
Living right under a cloud
The odds are against you
The gods haven't blessed you
You better get back on the rails

Drill down on the data
Keep pushing the paper
The damps dripping down on the walls
It's a million to one
There's a place in the Sun
To dance with the big boys again

It's a strange, strange game
Strange, oh, so strange
You don't even know my real name
It's a strange game

You got to carry the blame
In this strange strange game
You're out on a limb
Trying hard to get in
It's a strange game
